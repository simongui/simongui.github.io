I'm excited to announce that later this month I'll be joining the engineering team at [Storj Labs](https://storj.io)! 

Storj Labs is the company behind the Storj decentralized, private and secure cloud object storage technology. Storj is a really unique project. It's a decentralized storage system that has the potential to grow larger than any cloud storage system. It's also unique in the fact that anyone can run a storage node and get paid to be a storage node operator on the Storj network. The Storj network is S3 compatible and already storing `over 100 petabytes`. I'm really excited to join the team and help contribute.
